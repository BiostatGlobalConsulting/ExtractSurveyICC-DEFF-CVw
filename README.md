# ExtractSurveyICC-DEFF-CVw
Stata and R programs to extract useful parameters from survey datasets with complex sample designs and binary outcomes

These programs are being used to assemble a dataset of real-world survey parameters that are meant to be useful to those who plan future vaccination coverage surveys.  Contact Dale Rhoda for more details (e-mail address below).  These programs may be useful to people who work with other binary outcomes, and the ideas represented here could be extended to other outcomes that are not binary at the individual respondent level.

You might have arrived here via several different routes, having heard a talk by one of the staff from Biostat Global Consulting, or communicating with their network of collaborators around the world.  Have a look at the resources in the folders you find here and if you have questions, send a note to Dale.Rhoda@biostatglobal.com.
